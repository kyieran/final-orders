    <h1><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Final Orders</p></h1>
    <p><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">The humans ventured further into the dungeon, with each step seemingly harder to take, no human would dare to set foot in the these Caverns after their involuntary eviction by Phobus.</p></p>
    <p><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">"This plan is so screwed, we are being sent to our deaths! Comrades! Shouldn't we have just snuck off to the woods? We aren't getting out of here alive!" Cravon said, apart from the other two, i did not feel uneasy when we were just up against those burnt skeletons, which nearly ended our run here when Novaak tripped on a rock. Those skeletons... They don't look much different from regular ones, but they seem darker in color when you're actually up against one in here, I might just be hallucinating or just that this whole place is dark.</p></p>
    <p><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">"So, what are you guys gonna do before our imminent doom? Heh, i'd beg for my life and maybe i'll live!" Novaak joked, nobody laughed, but it did sound like a good plan, maybe these guys can actually teach me, rather than lecture me on why i am not allowed to learn Fallacious magic by Kosima!</p></p>
